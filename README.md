# Automatic Tab Closer for Chrome

This Chrome extension helps manage too many open tabs by automatically closing inactive ones based on user preferences. It is designed to reduce clutter while ensuring that important tabs stay open.

## Features

### **Close Tabs After (Minutes)**
You can specify a time interval (in minutes) to wait before the extension begins closing inactive tabs. No tabs will be closed before this time limit is reached, allowing you to control how long inactive tabs remain open.

### **Max Tabs Limit**
Set the maximum number of open tabs. Once this limit is exceeded, the extension will automatically close the least recently used tabs until the total number of tabs falls within the specified limit. This prevents tab overload while keeping your active and important tabs accessible.

### **Pin Tabs to Prevent Closure**
By checking the box next to a tab, you can pin it to prevent automatic closure. Pinned tabs will remain open, even if they exceed the maximum tab limit. This feature ensures that your critical tabs are always safe from automatic closure.

### **Active Tabs Stay Open**
Tabs that are actively in use, such as those where a video is playing or the user is currently browsing, will never be closed. Whether or not they are pinned, active tabs are prioritized and kept open, ensuring your workflow remains uninterrupted.

### **Countdown Timer**
For each inactive tab, a countdown timer is displayed, showing the remaining time before the tab will be automatically closed. This timer is based on the inactivity duration youâ€™ve set. If a tab becomes active again, the timer resets, giving you full control over when tabs are closed.

### **Closed Tabs History**
Closed tabs are stored for 2 to 3 days, allowing you to revisit them if needed. You can view the titles of the recently closed tabs, along with their icons, and click on them to reopen the pages. Each closed tab is also marked with the exact date and time it was closed, helping you track when specific tabs were removed.

### **Tab Icons**
The extension fetches and displays the icon (favicon) for each tab, making it easy to visually identify the tabs you want to keep open or close. This feature is particularly helpful when managing a large number of tabs, allowing quick access based on recognizable site icons.

### **Notification Popups**
Just before a tab is about to close, a notification popup will alert you, giving you the opportunity to interact with the tab and prevent its closure. These notifications are only shown if you have Chrome notifications enabled.

## How It Works

1. Set your desired inactivity time and maximum tab limit.
2. The extension starts monitoring tab activity and will automatically close the least recently used tabs once the maximum tab limit is reached.
3. Pin any tabs you want to stay open permanently, even if the limit is exceeded.
4. Closed tabs can be accessed and reopened from the history within a 2-3 day period.
5. Keep track of when tabs are set to close with the countdown timer displayed for inactive tabs.

## Customization Options
