This is an automatic tab closer for too many open tabs in chrome.

Close Tabs after (minutes):
Specify the amount of time in minutes that you want to wait before starting to close too many open tabs. No tabs will be closed before then.

Max Tabs:
You can set the maximum amount of tabs you want open. The extension will close the least used tabs till it gets to that maximum number of tabs and will stop.

Pin tabs:
Checking the check box beside the tabs that are open will pin the tabs so that they do not close no matter what. Even though your pinned tabs exceed the max amount of tabs you specified they wont be closed

Active tabs:
The tabs that are active will never close so that if a user is 
watching a video or scrolling the tab will always be open whether or not it is a pinned tab.

Countdown timer:
Tabs that have not been active for a while will begin a countdown timer 
relative to how long the user wants opened and unused tabs to last before being closed

Closed tabs:
Closed tabs will last 2 to 3 days in storage and can always be revisited by clicking the tab titles which are direct links to the closed page. Closed tabs also leave a day and time of when they were closed so the user can track which tab it might have been.

Notification popups:
just before tabs close theyre is a notification that the user will get to tell them that a tab will be closing soon. If they have their chrome notifications enabled.
